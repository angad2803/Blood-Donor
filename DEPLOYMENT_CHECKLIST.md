## 📋 Git Commands

```bash
# 1. Check status (ensure no sensitive files)

git add .

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "feat: Initial Blood Donation Dashboard implementation

# 5. Push
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 Final Verification

Before pushing, verify these files are NOT in `git status`:

- ❌ `Server/.env`
- ❌ `node_modules/`
- ❌ `make-admin.js` (root level)
- ❌ Any `*.log` files
- ❌ `dist/` or `build/` folders

## 📚 Post-Push Setup for Others

After someone clones your repo, they need to:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **Setup environment:**

   ```bash
   cp Server/.env.example Server/.env
   # Edit Server/.env with real values
   ```

3. **Start development:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Create first admin (after registering):**
   ```bash
   cd Server
   node scripts/make-admin.js your-email@example.com
   ```
