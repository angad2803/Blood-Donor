# GSAP Animation Error Fix

## Issue Resolved

Fixed GSAP animation error in `BloodRequestCarousel.jsx` where the animation was attempting to animate null/undefined elements in the refs array.

## Problem

The error occurred because:

- `cardsRef.current` array contained null/undefined elements
- GSAP's `fromTo` method was trying to animate these null elements
- This caused runtime errors and prevented smooth animations

## Solution Implemented

Updated the animation code in `BloodRequestCarousel.jsx` to:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Animate cards entrance
  if (cardsRef.current.length > 0) {
    // Filter out null refs before animating
    const validRefs = cardsRef.current.filter((ref) => ref !== null);
    if (validRefs.length > 0) {
      gsap.fromTo(
        validRefs,
        { opacity: 0, y: 30, scale: 0.95 },
        {
          opacity: 1,
          y: 0,
          scale: 1,
          duration: 0.6,
          stagger: 0.1,
          ease: "power2.out",
          delay: 0.2,
        }
      );
    }
  }
}, [requests]);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Added null filtering**: `filter(ref => ref !== null)` removes null/undefined elements
2. **Added validation check**: Ensures `validRefs.length > 0` before animating
3. **Used filtered array**: GSAP now only animates valid DOM elements

## Result

- ✅ GSAP animations now work smoothly without errors
- ✅ Blood request carousel displays and animates properly
- ✅ No more runtime errors related to null element animation
- ✅ Maintains the smooth entrance animation for cards

## Impact

This fix ensures that the blood request carousel:

- Displays properly on all screens
- Animates smoothly when requests are loaded
- Handles edge cases where some card refs might be null
- Provides a better user experience without console errors
