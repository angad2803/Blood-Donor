# Embedded ArcGIS Directions for Accepted Offers

## Enhancement Implemented

Added embedded ArcGIS directions functionality to the "Accepted Offers" section, ensuring consistent navigation experience across all components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dashboard.jsx

- Added `onGetDirections` prop to the AcceptedOffers component
- This passes the same directions handler used by the Blood Request Carousel

```jsx
{
  activeTab === "accepted" && (
    <AcceptedOffers
      onOpenChat={handleOpenChat}
      onGetDirections={handleGetDirections}
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Updated AcceptedOffers.jsx

- Added `onGetDirections` as a prop parameter
- Modified `handleGetDirections` function to use embedded ArcGIS directions

```jsx
const AcceptedOffers = ({ onOpenChat, onGetDirections }) => {
  const handleGetDirections = (offer) => {
    // ...coordinate validation...

    // Use the new onGetDirections prop if available (for embedded ArcGIS directions)
    if (onGetDirections) {
      // Create a request-like object for compatibility with the directions handler
      const requestForDirections = {
        requester: {
          coordinates: {
            coordinates: [reqLon, reqLat],
          },
        },
        location: offer.bloodRequest.location,
        hospitalName: offer.bloodRequest.hospitalName,
      };
      onGetDirections(requestForDirections);
      return;
    }

    // Fallback to external maps if onGetDirections is not provided
    // ...existing external maps logic...
  };
};
```

## How It Works

### For Accepted Offers

1. **User clicks "Get Directions"** on an accepted offer
2. **Data transformation**: The offer data is transformed into a request-like object compatible with the existing directions handler
3. **Route to embedded directions**: The same `handleGetDirections` function from Dashboard.jsx is called
4. **Auto-switch to map view**: If in list view, automatically switches to map view
5. **Show embedded route**: Displays the route using ArcGIS Directions widget on the embedded map
6. **User feedback**: Toast notification confirms the directions are shown

### Fallback Safety

- If `onGetDirections` prop is not provided, falls back to external maps
- Ensures backward compatibility and robustness

## User Experience Benefits

✅ **Consistent Navigation**: Same embedded directions experience across Blood Requests and Accepted Offers

✅ **No External Redirects**: Users stay within the app when getting directions to accepted offer locations

✅ **Automatic View Switching**: Clicking directions from any tab automatically switches to map view with route displayed

✅ **Professional Experience**: Full ArcGIS-powered navigation throughout the entire application

## Testing

To test this feature:

1. Navigate to the "Accepted Offers" tab
2. Click "Get Directions" on any accepted offer
3. Should automatically switch to map view and display the embedded route
4. Should show toast notification: "Switched to map view with directions!" or "Directions shown on map!"

## Result

Now both the Blood Request Carousel and Accepted Offers use the same embedded ArcGIS directions system, providing a seamless and professional navigation experience throughout the entire application.
